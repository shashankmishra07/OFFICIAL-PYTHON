# in python there will be three types of polymorphism
# 1 Duck type
# 2 overloading = overloading will be three types
                   # 1 operator overloading
                   # 2 method overloading (not support in oython)
                   # 3 constructer overloading

# overriding = there will be two types of overriding
                   # 1 method overriding
                   # 2 constructer overriding

# method overloading = in python , method overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but diffrent parameter. however python does not support method overloading

#method overloading  = when we declare more than one function with having same name but passing parameter is diffrent. these concept is known as function/method overloading
#however python does not support method overloading


#Operator overloading = when we perform addition, subtrattion , multiplication and comparision so on ,  ON THE OBJECT of an class we can overload the operator using magic methods

# operator overloading = operTOR OVERLOADING IS A FEATURE IN PYTHON  that allows devlopers to redefine the operator behavier of mathemetical and comparision oepartor for custom data types.
# this means that you can use the standard mathemetical operator (+-*/,etc) and comparision opreator (>< == <= >= etc) in your own class , just as you would for built in data types like int float str
